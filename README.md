# Meteor Skeleton

Lately I have found myself rewriting a lot of code when creating a new Meteor application. That's why I've created this skeleton, to make it easier to get started with a new project.

This skeleton contains the following packages:
* Aldeed Collection2
* CoffeeScript
* Fastclick
* Fourseven SCSS
* Gfk Notifications
* Kadirahq Flow Router
* Kadirahq Blaze Layout
* Wolves Bourbon
